The Pi Tau Zeta webcam has been running since December of 1996. We \
believe that this is the oldest webcam on the internet that is still \
operating and features human subjects (as opposed to fish or \
coffeepots).  <br><br> Here are excerpts from when the Basha lounge \
webcam (<a href=\"http://www.mitwebcam.com\">www.mitwebcam.com</a>) \
and //the kitchen webcam (<a \

//have been featured in the news: \

article about R.I.T.'s Computer Science House included a sidebar on \
\"college campus gadgets,\" featuring a screenshot and description of \
the PTZ webcam (text below). It also included a description of Random \
Hall's laundry server. Earlier in this issue is an article about a \
strange new search engine called \"Google!\" (yes, it was spelled with \
an exclamation point back then).  <br><br> <i><b>Speaker of the \
House</b><br> The Pi Tau Zeta Basha Lounge Webcam Web page \
[theghetto.mit.edu/webcam.htm] lets site visitors talk to M.I.T. Pi \
Tau Zeta fraternity brothers </i>[sic]<i> via the Net. Type a comment \
into the page's \"Message to say\" field and hit Return, and the \
frat's computer will speak your typed words to anyone passing through \
the house lounge. You even have a few voice options: American male, \
American female, or \"Roger,\" a saucy Brit.</i> </td></tr></table> \
